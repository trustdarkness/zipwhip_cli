zipwhip_cli
===========

This is a command line interface to the ZipWhip cloud texting service.

A short backstory:  I hate typing on my phone.  Thus, when Google Voice
came out, I was happy to have an alternative to text via my computer.
Later, I became a privacy nut and pulled my data out of Google's services
but I found I really missed the functionality of Google Voice for texting.

ZipWhip doesn't have all of that functionality, but it has some of it, and
though there is no privacy inherint in ZipWhip's service, I don't need 
to lock into a whole ecosystem to use it like I do Google Voice. 

Though I give kudos to ZipWhip for making a linux client, they 
unfortunately made it only for Ubuntu and did not release the source.
I used the web interface on Fedora for some time, but grew tired of having
to use up an extra tab just for that.  Thankfully, the folks at ZipWhip
have a great API.

So, I threw together this very basic command line interface.  It currently
has ZERO bells and whistles.  It will allow you to view the last message
in every conversation in your texting "inbox" and it will allow you to send
text messages via a phone number.

Usage is pretty simple:

    $ zwcli -h
    usage: zwcli.py [-h] [-c] [-r READ] [-s] [-t TO] [-m MSG] [-u USER]
                [-p PASSWORD] [-R] [-g]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c, --cron            Run in 'cron' mode, or non-interactively... meant for
                            cron jobs or watch processes. Defaults to 'read' mode,
                            reading recent texts to standard out. Can be combined
                            with -s for send or -r for read,
      -r READ, --read READ  Read the last X text messages to std out. Can be run
                            like ./zwcli.py -r20 to read only the last 20
                            messages, defaults to 10
      -s, --send            Run in send mode. Must be combined with -t and -m (but
                            may be also be combined with -u and -p to specify a
                            user and password, for use with cron, etc.
      -t TO, --to TO        Number to send a message to, must be combined with -s
                            and -t Currently must be a phone number, a named
                            contacts will not work.
      -m MSG, --msg MSG     Message to send. Must be combined with -s and -t.
                            Length is limited by either zipwhip or your carrier.
                            Nothing is guaranteed. enclose your message in quotes
                            for best results, like: ./zwcli.py -s -t5555555555
                            -m'LOL ROFLMAOBBQ!!!'
      -u USER, --user USER  Username / Phonenumber to send from. Currently must be
                            a 10 digit phone number that is already setup on
                            zipwhip in the form 5555555555. If you don't supply a
                            username, we will try to use a previously saved one or
                            prompt you on the console.
      -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                            Password for zipwhip account to send from. Beware bash
                            history! If you don't supply a password, we will try
                            to use a previously saved one or prompt you on the
                            console.
      -R, --markread        Mark all messages as read. Must be used with -r.
      -g, --gui             Display gui notifications

TODOS:
======

Full GUI support.  GUI notifications are now supported.

To run this, use the command line option -g… you’ll still see the normal command line output, but additionally, when you get new messages, they will display a notification in your desktop environment.

Now, you may ask, how does this help me if I’m running it manually on the command line?

I frequently run this in a watch loop, which is essentially like having a running daemon (but way, way, dumber).

Now, if I forget to look at the terminal window where I’m running it, I still get notified of new messages.

So, how I run it… to check for messages every 5 minutes, and mark them as read after displaying the notification, is to run the following:

    watch -n300 python zwcli.py -c -g -R

If you want to keep getting new notifications every 5 minutes until you explicitly mark as read, just omit the -R.

I’ll be making a proper daemon that you can interact with soon(ish).

If you've stumbled across this and use it, please let me know!
